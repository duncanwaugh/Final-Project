## Overview

Water quality management is vital for ecosystems and human health. This project addresses the limitations of traditional monitoring by leveraging multivariate time series forecasting. It employs advanced models like LSTM, TCN, TFT, and ARIMA to predict key water quality parameters, including:
- **Dissolved Oxygen**
- **Temperature**
- **Salinity**
- **pH**
- **Turbidity**

The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, seasonality visualization, and multi-horizon forecasting.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains **30,894 records** collected at **30-minute intervals** from the Brisbane River. Key variables include:
- **Temperature**: Affects chemical and biological processes.
- **Dissolved Oxygen**: Essential for aquatic life.
- **Chlorophyll**: Indicates algae concentration.
- **Turbidity**: Reflects water clarity.
- **Salinity**: Influences aquatic habitats.
- **pH**: Measures water's acidity/alkalinity.

Missing values and multivariate dependencies are handled through preprocessing, correlation analysis, and temporal feature engineering.
